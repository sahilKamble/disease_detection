This repository houses an annotated notebook focused on the plant disease detection segment of our B.Tech project. 
In the original project used 50 layer ResNet from pyTorch. Here I implenented 9 layer ResNet from scratch for illustration.
The full project can be found in another repository, which lacks comprehensive documentation. 
I've chosen to annotate and share my portion separately here.
